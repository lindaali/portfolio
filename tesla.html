                <h2><span id="intro-text">— INTRODUCTION —</span></h2>
                <p>In the summer of 2019, I had the exciting opportunity to intern at Tesla with the Power Electronics and Energy Products Team. The following is a collection of projects I worked on during this time.</p>
                
                <h2><span id="mid-text">— ROBOTIC TOOLING —</span></h2>
                <p>In a production setting, storage and transport around the facility is of utmost importance. For this project, I was involved in builidng, managing, and installing a robot cell. This project was one of many that were involved in building up a new production line. The main objectives for this was to modify the end of arm tooling (EOAT), modifying the robot enclosure, reducing costs, and validating production safety.</p>

            <div class="col-sm-3" id="banner-summary">
                <span style="font-size: 50px; color: #70a9d3;">

                </span>
                <h5>Modify EOAT</h5>

                    <i class="fas fa-home"></i>
                </span>
                <h5>Modify Enclosure</h5>

                </span>
                <h5>Reduce Costs</h5>
            </div>    
            <div class="col-sm-3" id="banner-summary">
                <span style="font-size: 50px; color: #70a9d3;">
                    <i class="fas fa-hard-hat"></i>
                </span>
                <h5>Validate Safety</h5>
            </div>
            
            <div class="col-sm-12">
                <h2 style="color: #70a9d3;"><span id="subtitle">MODIFY EOAT</span></h2>
                <p>The EOAT had already been designed when I was brought onto the team however, there were a couple design flaws. The major issue with the original design was with the actuating mechanism. The robot used pneumatic cylinders to lift and move objects. However, the designed cylinders were far too small for the forces experienced by the object being lifted and had the potential to drop the object in movement. Based on vendor specifications and calculations, I was able to select new cylinders with over three times the original factor of safety. After this change, I modified other components on the tooling to accommodate the new cylinders and added new auxillary features. Along with this, I did a brief mass analysis for the controls team with the redesigned EOAT for the total change in mass, center of mass, and mass moment of inertia.</p>
                
                <h2 style="color: #70a9d3;"><span id="subtitle">MODIFY ENCLOSURE</span></h2>
                <p>With the addition of an automated production robot to the line, we needed to build a full enclosure around it to ensure that no workers could be harmed when the robot was in operation. We found through trial tests that the robot exceeded the safety zone limits at the entrances at which workers refilled and moved products. To solve this, I added doors on the enclosure that would ensure that the robot would not be in the zone in which the operator was working in addition to a magnetic door holders and doorstops.</p>
                
                <h2 style="color: #70a9d3;"><span id="subtitle">COST REDUCTION</span></h2>
                <p>As a fallback, in case the robot was not ready by the start of production (SOP), I designed temporary pallets for workers to operate with until its completion. The orignal design for these pallets were to cost around $1,600 per pallet, obviously not cost effective for a temporary solution. I was able to reduce this cost to around $160 per pallet by taking the dimensional and deformation constraints and iterating through multiple composite, and cheaper, materials.</p>
                
                <h2 style="color: #70a9d3;"><span id="subtitle">SAFETY AND VALIDATION</span></h2>     
                <p>Safety tests are essential when integrating an automated system to a line. For this project, I developed an equipment specific factory acceptance test (FAT). This listed every possible hypothetical safety scenario and a correlated test to ensure that the robot has a command to follow.</p>    
                        
                        
                <h2><span id="mid-text">— BATTERY OPTIMIZATION —</span></h2>
                <p>As technology advances, we have to modify our products and equipment to accomodate those changes. For this project, the companies that source the battery cells used in the energy modules that power the vehicles and energy storage systems released new and improved cells. My role with this project was to accomodate the new cells with the product and integrate the new production operations that came with those changes. This project is estimated to have over $5M in annual savings.</p>
                
                <h2 style="color: #70a9d3;"><span id="subtitle">MACHINERY CHARACTERIZATION</span></h2>
                <p>Before making any physical changes to the product, I first characterized the machinery involved in the production of the modules by observing and talking to machinery operators. This allowed me to place constraints on the product redesign such that any changes I made would not be detrimental further down the line. From this, I was able to design the module to optimize the constraints given from the machinery and new battery cells.</p>
                
                <h2 style="color: #70a9d3;"><span id="subtitle">FIXTURE DESIGN</span></h2>
                <p>After defining the new module, I created a fixture to aid workers in the new production. After brief interviews with the operators, I designed a spring loaded tool and a stationay fixture to aid in the production of the module. This was prototyped multiple times to test and recieve feedback before finalizing and mass producing.</p>
                
                <h2 style="color: #70a9d3;"><span id="subtitle">PRODUCTION IMPLEMENTATION</span></h2>
                <p>Once the module and fixture designs were finalized, the last physical change that needed to come was with the line station design. The guarding that surrounded the machinery needed to be changed to accomodate the product and production changes. I redesigned the guarding surrounding the machinery to optimize the space using aluminum extrusions and polycarbonate sheets. Once the station changes were finalized, the only step remaining before the start of production (SOP) was a line trial.</p>
                
                
                    
                <h2><span id="mid-text">— PRODUCTION ERGONOMICS —</span></h2>
                <p>Along with the two main projects I talked about previously, I was assigned many smaller projects throughout the summer to help out other production needs. This included things like station redesigns, designing experiments, and testing product quality.</p>
