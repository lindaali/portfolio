                <p>Since February 2017, I have been a member of <a href="https://chemecar.engineering.cornell.edu/" target="_blank" style="color: #CC2800;"><b>Cornell University's ChemE Car</b></a> project team. We annually design, manufacture, and build <b>model vehicles that are solely powered by chemical reactions</b> for the AIChE Northeastern Regional Conference. Since our founding in 2004, we have won first place in the Regional and National Conferences several times. More impressive, we hold a <b>record number of four National Championships</b> in the world. As the mechanical subteam lead, I delgate tasks to my members to custom design and manufacture the chassis, enclosures, and supporting structures.</p>

                <h2><span id="intro-text">— CHEME CAR HISTORY —</span></h2>
                <p>To give a little context for the work I do, this is a breakdown of how the team operates and the roles for those on it. Within the overall team, we are separated into <b>nine subteams: four power teams, five support teams</b>. The power teams work to create the reactions that power the car while the support teams work on everything else to make the car move. On the mechanical subteam, each member of the team is assigned to become a liaison with one of the power teams. With this, they are able to learn everything about the reaction they are working on and can <b>custom design the chassis, mechanisms, and reaction containments to their specifications</b>.</p>
                
                <p>Since we have multiple power teams, each year provides the opportunity for a completely different reaction and car to compete. The goal of the competition is to move a distance with a load announced the day of. Because of this, the months before competition are filled with data collection and mock-competitions to ensure the accuracy and consistency of our car.</p>

                <h2><span id="mid-text">— FRESHMAN YEAR —</span></h2>
                <p>I was recruited onto the team during the spring semester of my freshman year. This time was mostly spent with onboarding to learn the basics of CAD programs such as Fusion360 and Solidworks. In addition to this, I was integrated into becoming the Battery Omega subteam liaison. At the time, they were working on a lead-acid battery. One of the main reactants in this battery is 6M sulfuric acid, so, they wanted me to help them create a custom battery cell containment that would be leak proof, acid resistant, and non-conductive. For this, I researched materials that would be feasible to manufacture with and meets the chemical requirements. </p>
                
                <h2><span id="mid-text">— SOPHOMORE YEAR —</span></h2>
                <p>During my second year on the team, I temporarily became the Thermoelectric Generator (TEG) liaison in addition to resuming my role as the Battery Omega liaison. I also helped with a standardization project within the Mechanical subteam to standardize features of the car.</p>
                
                <h2 style="color: #CC2800;"><span id="subtitle">BATTERY OMEGA</span></h2>
                <p>From the previous semester, I continued to develop a reaction containment for their battery that would be able to withstand the corrosive nature of sulfuric acid. I initially wanted to 3D print the containment and apply a chemically resistant coating, however, the coating cost over $600. In search of a less expensive solution, I found that glassware and polypropylene caps are inherently sufuric acid resistant and readily available. After some modifications to allow for wiring, the containments were ready for competition.</p>
                
                <p>After completing the reaction containment, the team was ready to start building the car itself. I based the chassis design on previous cars in Fusion360. I added many new stylized elements such as laser etching decorations and sponsors onto the sides. In addition to the chassis itself, I also redesign the safety guarding around the exposed motor and drivetrain. In preparation for competition, I complied an equipment list, as per the competition specifications. Finally, I created the <a href="img/chemecar/Regionals_Posters_2018.pdf" download target="_blank"  style="color: #CC2800;">poster</a> explaining all components of our car that won the poster competition.</p>

                <h2 style="color: #CC2800;"><span id="subtitle">TEG</span></h2>
                <p>TEG plates operate by creating a voltage through extreme temperature gradients. To create this temperature gradient, we create a reaction that is highly exothermic and cover the other side of the plate with dry ice. These plates are historically innefficient, so, we use multiple plates wired in series and parallel to output the desired voltage.</p>
                
                <p>Like with Battery Omega, TEG was having problems trying to find a sufficient reaction containment. The issues they were seeing with their current vessel was that it was warping when pressure was applied to ensure solid contact with the plates. The warping would not distribute the heat evenly across the plates and thus, performed poorly. I suggested that they changed their design from a "sandwich" to a tower where the plates would be lined vertically around the containment and it would be easier to apply pressure uniformly. We tested this idea using a tall metal container and saw that there was a significant increase in power. At this point, the new Mechanical recruit was fully onboarded and took over this project from me.</p>

                <!--<h2 style="color: #CC2800;"><span id="subtitle">STANDARDIZATION</span></h2>
                <p>In previous years, we had worked on a motor characterization project that's goal was to determine the relationship between variables such as voltage, speed, torque, and load. As a team, we decided to redirect this goal to standardizing mechanical features on the car. To start this, we tested for the threshold voltage for our DC motor under various loads ranging from 0 - 8kg by incrementally increasing the voltage until the car was able to move a set distance. We found that as we varied the load, the threshold voltage increased very slightly with the load. However, it noticeably changed the speed at which the car moved at.</p>-->
                
                <h2><span id="mid-text">— JUNIOR YEAR —</span></h2>
                <p>This was the year I took over as the Mechanical subteam lead. In addition to my previous responsibilities, I took on administrative tasks such as recruiting and organizing skill workshops. Other duties included planning meetings, delagating projects, creating timelines, and enforcing deadlines.</p>

                <h2 style="color: #CC2800;"><span id="subtitle">PROJECTS</span></h2>
                <p>These are projects I assigned to my members in addition to their liaison responsibilities. Thoughout the year, I checked in frequently and aided when needed.</p>
                
                <h2 style="color: #931D00;"><span id="subsubtitle">stir box</span></h2>
                <p>The iodine clock reaction is used to stop our vehicle at the desired distance. This reaction occurs when two clear solutions are mixed and turn a dark opaque blue at a specific time, based on the concentrations of the reactants. Currently, these solutions were mixed on the car using a syringe and bottle. However, we noticed that there were some irregularities in timing due to insufficient mixing. As a result, we designed a new stir box to help mix the chemicals on the car.</p>
                
                <p>The stir box consists of a fan with two neodymium magnets attached at opposite blades of the fan. The rest of the box was constructed to accommodate the new mechanism and improve upon the previous design.</p>
                
                <h2 style="color: #931D00;"><span id="subsubtitle">safety guarding</span></h2>
                <p>As mentioned previously, I redesigned the safety guarding around the exposed motor and drivetrain. The main reason for this was that it was very tedious to attach the guarding underneath the base of the chassis using velcro or nuts and screws. Ease of access was important for this design as we frequently needed to reach the motor to run tests. One of my members suggested that we use a sliding mechanism to attach the guarding, yet still have easy access.</p>
