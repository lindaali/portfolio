                <p>To design a human-centered product, we needed to understand the people we were designing for.

                <p>After collecting our empathy fieldwork, we began unpacking and analyzing the data points in terms of facts, emotions, <b><span style="color:#ff7400;">insights</span>, <span style="color:#27e6e7;">needs</span>, and <span style="color:#ff009a;">surprises</span></b>.

This helped us frame the problem and guide our ideas. We then took each data point and categorized them into 5 overarching groups. Subgroups were then created within each general group and relationships were found again. Our main categories of user needs were <b>impairments (30%), enrichment (30%), emotional peace (21%), necessities (14%), and caregivers (10%).</b></p>

From this, we came up with over 100 different products including a modular walker, a device to help zip up clothing, and even an outdoor walking conveyor belt system. We then took each idea and grouped them into categories of similar products and rated them based on their financial and technical feasibility versus user desirablity. Based on feedback from our industry advisors and our data analysis, we moved forward with the <b>no-lift trashcan</b>.</p>

We had multiple ideas in mind for the lift including scissor lifts, hand cranks, pulleys, and a rack and pinion, however, the main function of this first protoype was to gather feedback on the concept overall.</p>

                <h2 style="color:#915F29; padding-top:50px;"><span id="subsubtitle">testing fieldwork</span></h2>
                <p>We then took our first prototype to the streets. We talked to friends, family, and senior citizens in different environments and had them interact with our prototype. We received a lot of helpful feedback such as that most people preferred a foot pedal to a hand crank/lever. We also talked to many people who were satisfied with their current situation, but, we believe that many of these people had not thought about improvements to their current trash situation. A lot of people also commented on the usefulness of our product for seniors with back problems or other limitations without even knowing that the product's intended audience was senior citizens.</p>
                
                <h2 style="color:#915F29;"><span id="subsubtitle">conjoint analysis</span></h2>
                <p>In addition to the testing fieldwork, we also created a conjoint analysis survey that was posted publicly. This survey asked users to rank the value of different attributes such as cost and mechanism. It then took those attributes and created numerous combinations of them all and asked users to rank the combinations overall. From this we discovered that the average consumer places more importance on the aesthetics and cost of the product, rather than the technical elements that we initially deemed most valuable.</p>

                <p>We took the feedback from testing and the survey results and related it back to our initial goals. What we came up with was that this product would change the game for individuals with back issues, that it would need to function well and fit in nicely with the rest of the home in order for people to want it, and that some different disabilities would require different solutions.</p>
                
                <p>This was the point where we really began refining our lifting mechanism. We decided to use a scissor lift to raise the platform and a pneumatic cylinder to convert the oscillatory pedal motion to a linear motion. We used two of these scissor lifts on either side of the platform for added stability which are connected by a stationary bar propelled by the piston. The piston operates using the compressed air created from the foot pump. We used a single acting cylinder to take advantage of the internal springs to retract the piston when we want the platform to lower. In addition, we integrated track rails and rollers for the scissor lifts to prevent binding and to achieve a smooth motion.</p>
