                <p>Since September 2018, I have been a member of <a href="http://cusolarboat.org/" target="_blank" style="color: #70a9d3;"><b>Cornell University's Solar Boat</b></a> project team. We annually design, manufacture, and build a <b>seventeen foot, single occupant, solar powered speed boat</b> for the intercollegiate Solar Splash competition. In June of 2019, we placed in the top ten at our first showing in competition. In addition, we won the Rookie of the Year 2019 and Outstanding Solar System Design awards. This year, I designed the drivetrain's <b>transmission and housing</b> with goals of weight reduction and easier serviceability and manufacturability from previous designs.</p>

                <h2><span id="intro-text">— DRIVETRAIN HISTORY —</span></h2>
                <p>Before diving into the new design, we have to discuss previous designs and why mine is better. Initially, with the team's founding in 2015, the drivetrain for the boat was designed to be an inboard motor. The advantages of this design is that it has superior torque and power to an outboard motor, making it ideal for speedboats. However, inboard motors have the disadvantage of being much more difficult to design and manufacture, with small errors creating large misalignments. In the 2019 season, we decided to completely redesign the drivetrain to be an outboard motor to help prevent these manufacturing errors. This had the added benefit of eliminating the need for a rudder with steering.</p>
                <img src="img/cusb/inoutboard.jpg" width=500px class="center"/>
                
                <h2><span id="mid-text">— GOALS —</span></h2>
                <p>With the decision to transition from an inboard motor, we quickly designed a preliminary outboard drivetrain with the knowledge that it would be very basic as it was our first design iteration. From this, a couple design requirements for the 2020 season emerged: reduced weight, easier manufacturability and assembly, improved sealing and waterproofing, and motor optimization.</p>

            <div class="col-sm-12">
                <h2><span id="mid-text">— OVERALL DESIGN —</span></h2>
                <p>This design was inspired by existing commercial outboard motors, and thus, is very similar in mechanics. The motor is mated to a vertical driveshaft which in turn drives the gearbox to provide torque to the propeller shaft. A lovejoy will be used to couple the motor to the driveshaft for easy accessibility. An aluminum housing surrounds all internal components to protect them from water corrosion and acts as a mounting system for the steering components. The housing is a key difference between the 2019 and 2020 design as the 2019 version used steel. Steel is significantly heavier than aluminum and switching materials will reduce the weight of the drivetrain from 130lbs to 50lbs.</p>
                
                <p>The drivetrain is assembled completely with bolted fasteners to avoid welding. The use of steel for the housing in 2019 was to weld components together as welding aluminum is far more difficult than welding steel. I chose design without relying on welding as I believed the weight saved from using aluminum would be more beneficial. In addition, we do not have members who are trained welders and thus, would have had to outsource components to a third party. Using bolts also adds the challenge of sealing all the holes that will be making contact with water. Lastly, all components of the drivetrain were designed to be fully assembled outside of the main housing to allow for comfortable tool clearances.</p>
                
                <p>In terms manufacturing, our team has access to a fully furnished machine shop and is trained to use most machines. However, we do not currently have anyone trained to use the CNC. As a result, this project presented unique challenges for a manually machined design.</p>

                <p>This project was developed over the course of two academic semesters. The first semester was dedicated to the design process where the drivetrain was conceptualized, iterated, and analyzed through multiple design reviews. Manufacturing and validation were reserved for the second semester as competition drew closer.</p>

                <h2 ><span id="intro-text">— DESIGN PARAMETERS —</span></h2>
                <p style="text-align: center;">The shafts, gears, and bearings are the biggest driving parameters for this design.</p>
                
                <h2 style="color: #70a9d3;"><span id="subtitle">SHAFTS</span></h2>
                <p>To determine the shaft diameter and material, I calculated the shear stress, twist angle, factor of safety, and mass for the longest potential driveshaft length we would use. These calculations were then iterated through numerous shaft diameters and materials using a custom MATLAB script. The final shaft was selected to be a 0.5" 630 stainless steel shaft due to its high strength and low mass.</p>
                <img src="img/cusb/shaftmat.png" width=600px class="center"/>
                
                <h2 style="color: #70a9d3;"><span id="subtitle">GEARS</span></h2>
                <p>The gears will be straight bevel gears. While helical bevel gears are quiter, they require more difficult calculations and are less readily available. To select the gears, I calculated the gear contact stress, bending stress, and factors of safety of a variety of off the shelf gears using a custom MATLAB script. From this, an 18-tooth 12 DP AISI 1045 steel bevel gear will be used. These will have a factor of safety of 0.609 unhardened. In light of this, we will through harden them with an HRC of 36-40, increasing the factor of safety to 1.54. These gears will be run with a 1:1 ratio in an oil bath and axially constrained with custom shims.</p>
                <img src="img/cusb/gearselect.png" width=600px class="center"/>
                
                <h2 style="color: #70a9d3;"><span id="subtitle">BEARINGS</span></h2>
                <p>The bearings used for this system must be able to accommodate both radial and axial loads from the motor and thrust produced. For this, there are three options: deep groove ball bearings, ball bearings and thrust bearings, and tapered roller bearings. Deep groove ball bearings can accommodate both raidal and axial loads. This option is ideal if the load ratings fit our system, the axial load is the limiting factor. Ball bearings accommodate raidal loads while thrust bearings accommodate axial loads. A combination of both will allow us to select bearings specific to the radial and axial loads. Finally, taper roller bearings can also accommodate both radial and axial loads, however, they are difficult to manufactur alignment, must be preloaded, and are very large and overbuilt in comparison to the other options. As a result, I chose to design with both ball and thrust bearings as it is the simplest option.</p>
                <p>After selecting the gears, I was able to calculate the bearing loads on the system using force balances. This was the final parameter needed to fully define the design.</p>

                <p>The lower unit houses the transmission from the motor to the propeller. It consists of the gearbox housing, gears, two bearing housings, a nosecone, and a prop shaft.</p>

                <p>The gearbox housing contains all of the transmission components. It was designed to be manufactured from round stock with machined flats on the top and bottom to act as mounting points. There will also be an oil inlet and gauge to allow for the gears to be run in an oil bath</p>

                <p>There are two bearing housings in the lower unit, one in the front and one in the rear. These house the press fitted bearings and shaft seals. There are multiple o-rings to keep water out of the gearbox and keep the oil in. They will each insert into the housing as one unit and have different bolt patterns to prevent them from being assembled the wrong way.</p>

                <p>To assemble the lower unit, the rear and front units are bolted to the gearbox housing. The rear unit consists of the nosecone, rear endcap, and rear thrust block. These components will be bolted together as one unit with separate bolts attaching it to the gearbox housing. This allows us to remove the rear unit from the housing while keeping all the components together. The front unit simply bolts to the housing after the spacers and gears are lined up on the shaft.</p>

                <p>There are two bearing housings in the driveshaft unit, one on top and one on the bottom. The bearing housing on top doubles as the shaft coupler housing. The main difference between these housings as opposed to the ones on the lower unit is that they are mounted to the driveshaft housing with radially mounted bolts.</p>

                <p>The driveshaft unit is assembled by bolting the lower and upper bearing housings to the driveshaft housing. The shaft coupler housing is radially bolted to the motor mounting plate for the easy removal of the motor without disassembling the rest of the drivetrain.</p>

                <p>The final step for assembling the full drivetrain is to bolt the driveshaft unit and lower unit together. This is done on the lower bearing housing and the gearbox housing. Both the driveshaft unit and lower unit will be preassembled before the final assembly to allow for sufficient tool clearances and eliminate awkward assembly positions. All of the bolts on this assembly will be wrapped in teflon tape to ensure they are watertight. I also standardized all of the bolts throughout the entire design to try to make assembly as quick and easy as possible.</p>

                <h2><span id="mid-text">— ANALYSIS —</span></h2>
                <p>After the design was mostly finalized, I ran some simulations on the assembly in ANSYS. This allowed me to see dynamic loads and deformations on the housing and shafts that are difficult to calculate by hand. From this, I determined that the design would be able to withstand the forces applied in the real world. <!--The only concern would be on the four bolts that connect the driveshaft unit to the lower unit as the calculations showed significant deformation and stressese, however, I found this to be a boundary condition issue with the program rather than a design flaw.--></p>
