                <h2><span id="intro-text">— INTRODUCTION —</span></h2>
                <p>In my Mechanical Synthesis class, I was paired with five students with diverse backgrounds and industry experience to <b>design and manufacture a water pump</b> that could <b>move one liter of water in one minute</b>. Our pump ultimately pumped over five liters in the time provided!</p>

                <h2><span id="intro-text">— PUMP SELECTION —</span></h2>
                <p>The first step to build our pump was to select which pump we wanted to design and build. For this, we researched three types: piston, peristaltic, and gear.</p>
                
                <h2 style="color: #FFCC00;"><span id="subtitle">PISTON PUMP</span></h2>
                <p>Piston pumps utilize their linear actuation motion to intake and expel fluids from one place to another. The benefits of this is that it is easy to manufacture, maintain, and repair, and has low manufacturing costs. However, the parts are prone to wear so maintainance costs can be high. For manufacturability and cost reasons, we chose this pump to move forward with. This pump also displaces the most amount of fluid for a given power input. </p>
                
                <h2 style="color: #FFCC00;"><span id="subtitle">PERISTALTIC PUMP</span></h2>
                <p>Peristaltic pumps utilize a rotor with rollers to compress a flexible tube filled with fluid. As the rotor turns, the fluid is forced through the tube. These are widely used in sterile environments as the fluid does not make contact with with pump. With our goal of displacing as much fluid as possible, this is not ideal as it has a lower power to displacement ratio.</p>
                
                <h2 style="color: #FFCC00;"><span id="subtitle">GEAR PUMP</span></h2>
                <p>Gear pumps utilize the meshing of gears and the creation of suction to move fluids from one place to another. These are best for displacing viscous fluids. For our applications, we decided against using this pump due to limitations in manufacturing because of the high precision required to make gears. In addition, this pump is not ideal for high flow rates.</p>
            </div>

                <h2 style="padding-top: 80px;"><span id="intro-text">— DESIGN —</span></h2>
                <p>To help guide our design, we created a functional decomposition chart as well as a morphological chart. A functional decomp determines the functional relationship of all components based on their individual function. A morph chart helps generate ideas for each component for its function. Based on these charts, we were able to consider all solutions for all components of the design. To maximize our flow rate, we wanted to build a dual piston pump connected by a scotch yoke.</p>

                <h2 style="color: #FFCC00;"><span id="subtitle">PISTON</span></h2>
                <p>Integrating two pistons into our design allowed it to be symmetrical. After some rough power calculations, we determined the stroke length that would maximize our volume displaced while taking into consideration the size constraints. This stroke length would then become the diameter of our scotch yoke. We found our flow rate to be 0.157L/s and efficiency to be 41%.</p>
                
                <p>Each piston cylinder would be built using two aluminum end caps, one aluminum cylinder, four steel threaded rods, and eight locknuts to secure everything together. The piston rod was built using a steel threaded rod and PVC round stock. These were then mated to the scotch yoke mechanism.</p>

                <p>Our dual pistons are connected and propelled by a scotch yoke that converts the rotary motion of the motor into linear motion. Our driveshaft connected the motor to the scotch yoke with a press fitted ball bearing. This was then mated to the sliding yoke with a pin and bearing to prevent binding. The pin was held in place using retaining rings.</p>

                <p>The mounting plate is what I was most directly responsible for. This mounted the pistons the proper distance from each other and allowed us to mount the pump onto the motor. Since the aluminum stock provided was not long enough to accomodate our dual pistons, we fixed two smaller blocks onto the end.</p>

                <p>To assemble everything, the piston rods were threaded onto the scotch yoke and fastened into the mounting plate. This was then fastened to the motor mount plate which is not pictured below.</p>

                <h2><span id="intro-text">— MANUFACTURING —</span></h2>
                <p>Manufacturing and assembling the pump went relatively smoothly. The scotch yoke and piston heads were both machined on the lathe and finished on the mill. The mounting plate, endcaps, and sliding yoke were machined on the mill. Lastly, the bandsaw and vertical saw were used to cut the threaded rods and driveshaft down to size. Upon assembly, we focused on the smoothness of the piston movement. We sanded the piston heads to minimize the friction between it and the cylinder. We also added spacers to the scotch yoke and mounting plate to constrain all ranges of motion. During our dry run, our pump seemed to operate perfectly with minimal resistance.</p>

                <h2><span id="intro-text">— VALIDATION —</span></h2>
                <p>Our wet run did not run as smoothly as the dry run. In our first attempt, we discovered that we had sanded our piston heads too far. This loose seal allowed for too much leakage and only yielded 0.5L in total. To remedy this, we added a thin layer of tape to the edge of the piston heads to increase the sealing. After this, our second run showed that the increase in force required to move the piston caused the set screw securing the scotch yoke and the driveshaft to come loose. For this, we decided to reverse the driveshaft so the smaller set screw would be sitting on the motor keyway we had initially machined. This meant that the set screw on the motor sprocket was sitting on the round driveshaft, however, we believed that it was large enough that it would be able to hold. This proved true in our final run as we were able to pump a total of 5L in one minute. As can be seen in our final run shown below, there is still leakage occuring at the front of the piston. If we were to redo this project, we would want to integrate o-rings into the piston heads as we had initially designed to improve the sealing.</p>
